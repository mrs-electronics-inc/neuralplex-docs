Astro pages are just simple Markdown. If you want extra features, use a `.mdx` file.

See [this page](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/) for more information about authoring content.

## Example Section

Use `##` to add sections. If you want further nesting, use `###`, `####`, and so on.
