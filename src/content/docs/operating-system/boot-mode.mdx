The NeuralPlex offers two different boot modes.  Normal Mode and Recovery Mode.  Recovery mode is a minimal image meant to allow major in-field updates to the rootfs or bootloader partitions of the flash.  Recovery Mode allows you to reflash the entire rootfs partition, resize, or reconfigure the parition.

### Changing Boot Mode
Booting into Recovery Mode can be achieved by setting a u-boot environment variable:
```bash title="Change Boot Mode"
root@neuralplex:~# fw_setenv bootmode recovery
root@neuralplex:~# reboot
```

    Some configurations such as network configs may be different in Recovery Mode.  Before rebooting into Recovery Mode make sure that you have a method of gaining access to the console in Recovery Mode.

If you wish to change any configurations before booting into Recovery Mode, the rootfs for this paration is mounted at: `/diag`.
