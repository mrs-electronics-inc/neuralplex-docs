### Copying user application to NeuralPlex
The user application can be manually transferred to the NeuralPlex via Ethernet-over-USB.  If the filesystem is read-only, you will need to re-mount the drive as read-write before transferring:
```bash title="NeuralPlex"
# Mount drive as read-write
root@neuralplex:~# mount -o remount,rw /

# After you copy the file, mount the drive back to read-only
root@neuralplex:~# mount -o remount,ro /
```

```bash title="Development Machine"
# On development machine:
$ scp my-awesome-app root@192.168.5.100:/opt/my-awesome-app
```

### Starting user application manually
Add the permission to execute the application with the following commands:
```bash title="NeuralPlex"
root@neuralplex:~# chmod +x /opt/my-awesome-app
root@neuralplex:~# /opt/my-awesome-app
```

### Starting user Application Automatically
To start your application automatically, a systemd service is available and enabled by default.  This service will automatically restart if the user application crashes.  The systemd service is shown below:
```bash title="startup-app.service"
root@neuralplex:~# vi /etc/systemd/system/startup-app.service 
[Unit]
Description=Start Qt Application service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Environment="WAYLAND_DISPLAY=/run/wayland-0"
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/0"
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
ExecStart=/usr/bin/startup-app.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

As seen from the `ExecStart` command, the systemd service makes a call to `/usr/bin/startup-app.sh`.  Should you require modifying the app that starts at boot, you will need to modify this file:
```bash title="startup-app.sh"
root@neuralplex:~# vi /usr/bin/startup-app.sh 
#!/bin/bash

# Start app on screen #1 and send to background
/opt/neuralplex-demo/bin/neuralplex-demo-1 &

# Start app on screen #2
/opt/neuralplex-demo/bin/neuralplex-demo-2
```

### Enable/Disable Service
To enable or disable the default Startup-App service, run the following command:
```bash title="Enable/Disable Service"
# Disable
root@neuralplex:~# systemctl stop startup-app

# Enable
root@neuralplex:~# systemctl start startup-app

# Restart
root@neuralplex:~# systemctl restart startup-app
```
