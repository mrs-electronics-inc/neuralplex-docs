The current state of the system's GPIOs can be obtained in user-mode, as shown in the following example:
```bash title="gpiodetect"
root@neuralplex:~# gpiodetect
gpiochip0 [5d080000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip1 [5d090000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip2 [5d0a0000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip3 [5d0b0000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip4 [5d0c0000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip5 [5d0d0000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip6 [5d0e0000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip7 [5d0f0000.gpio] (32 lines)
```

| gpiodetect |	List all gpiochips present on the system, their names, labels and number of GPIO lines |
| gpioinfo |	List all lines of specified gpiochips, their names, consumers, direction, active state and additional flags |
| gpioget |	Read values of specified GPIO lines |
| gpioset |	Set values of specified GPIO lines, potentially keep the lines exported and wait until timeout, user input or signal |
| gpiofind |	Find the gpiochip name and line offset given the line name |
| gpiomon |	Wait for events on GPIO lines, specify which events to watch, how many events to process before exiting or if the events should be reported to the console |

### gpioget
The gpioget utility can be used to manipulate GPIO from the command line.

For example, to read the value of the `audio-reset` GPIO pin:
```bash title="gpioget"
root@neuralplex:~# gpioget -c4 24
"24"=inactive
```

### gpioset
The gpioset utility can be used to manipulate GPIO from the command line.

For example, to set the value of the `audio-reset` GPIO pin:
```bash title="gpioset"
root@neuralplex:~# gpioset -c4 24=1
```
